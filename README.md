# A-Game-of-Sticks
A simple program for playing pick up sticks with either a player or an AI. The AI can also train itself through a random trial and error system. The AI training program plays against an untrained AI in order to refine its random choice options.

## Getting Started
Easy clone:
```
mkdir -p ~/A-Game-of-Sticks/ && cd
git clone https://github.com/JeremyEudy/A-Game-of-Sticks
```
Or replace ```~/A-Game-of-Sticks/``` with a different valid location.

## Usage
chmod both .sh files and then execute ```setup.sh``` for first time setup and ```rebuild.sh``` to refresh the build.
```
chmod -x setup.sh
./setup.sh
./run.sh
```
